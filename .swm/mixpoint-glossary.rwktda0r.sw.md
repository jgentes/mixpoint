## `Track`<swm-token data-swm-token=":app/api/db/__dbSchema.ts:45:2:2:`type Track = {`"/>

A **track** is a song, stored as a music audio file such as .mp3 or .mp4. It is the basis for most of the actvity within Mixpoint. Tracks are combined into **mixes**, and mixes are combined into **sets**:

## `Stems`<swm-token data-swm-token=":app/api/db/appState.ts:30:2:2:`type Stems = {`"/>

A **stem** is a distinct type of sound within a track. Mixpoint can extract 4 types of stems from audio - drums, bass, vocals, and "other", which is mostly melody such as piano, synths, strings, etc.

<br/>

When playing a track that has stems, only the stems play. Combined, they sound identical to the original track.

Stems are much more useful than traditional frequency cuts (high, mid, low) because they isolate the specific element of the audio you're trying to remove. Additionally, they make finding beats much easier by allowing you to view only the drum stem, which can be difficult to see while looking at the combined waveform.

## `Mixpoint`<swm-token data-swm-token=":app/api/db/__dbSchema.ts:65:2:2:`type Mixpoint = {`"/>

A **mixpoint** is a specific time on a track where the next track begins to mix in. A track may have many mixpoints, each mixing into different tracks.

A **mix** is
